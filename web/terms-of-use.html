        <li>
            We promote open science through its mission to provide freely available online services, database and software relating to data contributed from life science experiments to the largest possible community. Where we present scientific data generated by others we impose no additional restriction on the use of the contributed data than those provided by the data owner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Attribution is expected (e.g. in publications, services or products) for any of our online services, databases or software in accordance with good scientific practice. The expected attribution is indicated on the About web page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any feedback provided to us on our online services will be treated as non-confidential unless the individual or organisation providing the feedback states otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
            We are not liable to you or third parties claiming through you, for any loss or damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            We do not store personal data of any kind. We may make information about the total volume of usage of particular software or data available to the public and third party organisations who supply the software or databases without details of any individual’s use.
        </li>
        <li>
            While we will retain our commitment to OpenScience, we reserve the right to update these Terms of Use at any time. When alterations are inevitable, we will attempt to give reasonable notice of any changes by placing a notice on our website, but you may wish to check each time you use the website. The date of the most recent revision will appear on this, the ‘Webchem Terms of Use’ page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use our online services. We will also make available an archived copy of the previous Terms of Use for comparison.
